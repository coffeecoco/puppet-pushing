This is puppet-pushing a puppet module for example puppet code and demos.

Please read the INSTALL file for instructions on getting this installed.
Look in the examples/ folder for usage. If none exist, please contribute one!
This code may be a work in progress. The interfaces may change without notice.
Patches are welcome, but please be patient. They are best received by email.
Please ping me if you have big changes in mind, before you write a giant patch.

Module specific notes:
* Things in the standalone directory run locally.
* The module requirements are versions of my modules from:
	https://github.com/purpleidea/
* Each example doesn't require all of these modules. Each example is different.

Dependencies:
* puppet-common
* puppet-runonce
* puppet-fsm


Happy hacking,
